      <h3>Shruthi Bhavaraju, UI/UX Specialist</h3>
      <p>
        Shruthi Bhavaraju is a graduate student, pursuing masters in information technology 
        and management at Illinois Institute of Technology, specializing in web designing and 
        application development. She did her bachelors in information technology from India.
        During her undergrad, to further understand about Web and Mobile Technologies and 
        to explore her earlier interests in mobile applications, she worked on a few projects.
        She is also interested in the design strategy, responsive web design, full-stack
        development, logo design and user experience. She enjoys being creative in web 
        design,  UI/UX design and graphic design. Shruthi is very passionate about web development, 
        especially in the UI/UX she likes understanding what the user's pain points are and making 
        the user interface seamless. So no matter what she is working on, her aim is to always have
         the user in mind and create an enjoyable experience for them.

      <h3>Dasha Day Hisoler, Frontend Specialist</h3>
      <p>
        Dasha Day Hisoler is pursuing both a bachelor's and master's degree in information
        technology and management at Illinois Institue of Technology, specializing in web and
        application development. Previously, she studied computer science at the University of the
        Philippines for two years. She is currently learning and working with big data and
        artificial intelligence, but knows that web development will always have a special place in
        her heart. She envisions herself with a career either as a UI/UX developer or a full stack
        developer, and she would love the chance to be part of creating something entirely new. She
        has written a few short literary research papers, the majority of which have been focused on
        technology in the lens of sociology. She has many interests she is eager to explore, such as
        graphic design, machine learning and cloud computing; and is also considering on getting a
        law degree (she thinks intellectual property might be fun to fight for). At the end of the
        day, she enjoys imagining that she would someday be coding on the beach of her hometown in
        the Philippines (with a coconut in hand) and just sending over code to the US—isn't that a
        thought!

      <h3>Karl Stolley, Director</h3>
      <p>
        Karl Stolley is an associate professor of information technology and management who
        researches both server- and client-side applications of established and emerging web
        standards. On the server side, he is interested in minimalist frameworks for lightweight
        development, data serialization formats, and the design of data APIs. On the client side, he
        focuses primarily on accessibility, including as achieved through progressive web
        applications. He also has a strong interest in interface and visual design, especially
        regarding web typography. A routine contributor to Mozilla Developer Network’s
        documentation, interactive code examples, and compatibility data, Stolley is enthusiastic
        about both studying and writing documentation. He is currently developing a book about
        antipatterns in HTML, an article on accessibility advances in the HTML and ARIA in HTML
        specifications, and two article-length surveys of web research in CS/IT over the last
        decade: one covering web-specific applied and theoretical research, and the other covering
        advances in web curriculum development and instruction.

      <h3>Karl Stolley, Director</h3>
      <p>
        Karl Stolley is an associate professor of information technology and management who
        researches both server- and client-side applications of established and emerging web
        standards. On the server side, he is interested in minimalist frameworks for lightweight
        development, data serialization formats, and the design of data APIs. On the client side, he
        focuses primarily on accessibility, including as achieved through progressive web
        applications. He also has a strong interest in interface and visual design, especially
        regarding web typography. A routine contributor to Mozilla Developer Network’s
        documentation, interactive code examples, and compatibility data, Stolley is enthusiastic
        about both studying and writing documentation. He is currently developing a book about
        antipatterns in HTML, an article on accessibility advances in the HTML and ARIA in HTML
        specifications, and two article-length surveys of web research in CS/IT over the last
        decade: one covering web-specific applied and theoretical research, and the other covering
        advances in web curriculum development and instruction.
